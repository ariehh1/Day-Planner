# Day-Planner

In this repository, I have created a day planner where a user can input tasks, activities, reminders, and notes. The top portion of the repository displays the current date of the scheduler. Within a standard work day (9:00am - 5:00pm),the scheduler denotes a specific color for time in the past, current time, and future time. On the far right portion of the scheduler, there is an option to save user input.
