# Day-Planner

In this repository, I have created a day planner where a user can input tasks, activities, reminders, and notes. The top portion of the repository displays the current date of the scheduler. Within a standard work day (9:00am - 5:00pm), the scheduler denotes a specific color for time in the past, current time, and future time. On the far right portion of the scheduler, there is an option to save user input. All of the user input is stored in localStorage upon hitting the save button.

This daily planner allows the user to glance at their work day, make adjustments that come up, and increase productivity. In not utilizing a daily planner, meetings, appointments, reminders, etc. could be missed throughout a given day. In creating this daily planner, I thought back to when I first purchased a planner to schedule my day, week, and plan for the month ahead.
